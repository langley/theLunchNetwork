# The Lunch Network in Play 2.1 
============================

## v 0.1 Features
-----------------
1. Create your user profile
2. Authentication against the user profiles
3. Trivial .css styling

###Technical decisions/assumptions:
-----------------------------------
1. use rdbms to show anorm
2. use Play forms instead of javascript forms. 
   Will convert to ajax in a future iteration
3. hopefully find some simple styling like 
   Twitter's bootstrap. 
4. Evaluate doing "mobile first" with jqm 
   (mobile 1st and a half?)  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file will be packaged with your application, when using `play dist`.
